// Deeply understand dom tree, root node , element nodes, text nodes

// now see how the browers reads/create the html file
// so the browser know, jo bhi add krna hai, woh document ke andr add krna hai
// the document is also called as root node, and document is a js object
// since document me html ke code ko add krna hai, toh html is a child of document, so html is called as root element or child node

// just like tree data structure

// now the head is a child node of html
// head k baad new line hai, i.e \n who bhi store hoga, store hoga tbhi toh new line aaega.  these khali jgh are called as text node

// also title is a child of head. title also has text, means title also have text node as a child 

// then title k baad again we have a new line (text node) and script child
// then again a new line and then head is done

// now script k phele we also have space.
// then we have body, and body k andar similar things


// traversing simply means to go from here to there
